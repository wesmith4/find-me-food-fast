# Find Me Food Fast
This was the first web app project for myself and my teammates [Rachel Mclean](https://github.com/rachel-mclean) and [Keith Ng](https://github.com/keithjng) during our Spring 2020 semester with Adjacent Academies.

The site provides an interface to filter San Francisco restaurants by neighborhood, price, and cuisine.  Restaurant information accessed from Yelp API.
